# High-Speed Data Logger with Signal Generation using STM32F4

## Project Overview
Develop a high-speed data logger using the STM32F4 microcontroller that captures analog signals at 7.2 Msps and stores the data for later analysis. Additionally, generate an analog test signal using the DAC to demonstrate the loggerâ€™s capabilities.

## Key Features
- **High Sampling Rate**: Achieve 7.2 Msps using triple interleaved ADCs.
- **Efficient Data Handling**: Use DMA to transfer data from ADCs to memory.
- **Data Storage**: Store the captured data in an external memory (e.g., SD card).
- **Signal Generation**: Generate a test analog signal using the DAC.
- **User Interface**: Basic interface to start/stop logging and indicate status.

## Components Needed
- **STM32F4 Discovery Board**: STM32F4 microcontroller for ADC, DAC, and DMA operations.
- **Analog Signal Source**: DAC on the STM32F4 to generate test signals.
- **SD Card Module**: For storing the logged data.
- **Supporting Components**: Breadboard, wires, power supply, etc.

## Project Plan

### 1. Set Up Development Environment
- **IDE**: Install STM32CubeIDE or another preferred IDE for STM32 development.
- **Libraries**: Download and install the STM32 HAL library and middleware components for SD card access (FATFS).

### 2. Configure Hardware

#### 2.1. STM32F4 Board Setup
- Connect the SD card module to the STM32F4 board using SPI or SDIO interface.
- Connect the DAC output to the ADC input pin.

### 3. Firmware Development

#### 3.1. Initialize Peripherals
- **ADC Configuration**:
  - Configure three ADCs in triple interleaved mode.
  - Set up the ADCs to achieve the combined sampling rate of 7.2 Msps.
- **DAC Configuration**:
  - Configure the DAC to generate a test signal.
- **DMA Configuration**:
  - Configure DMA in mode 2 to handle high-speed data transfer from ADCs to memory.

#### 3.2. Data Acquisition and Signal Generation
- Set up an interrupt or a timer to start ADC conversions.
- Use DMA to transfer data from the ADCs to a buffer in memory.
- Use a timer to trigger the DAC for signal generation.

#### 3.3. Data Storage
- Implement SD card initialization and file system (using FATFS).
- Write a function to store the buffered data into a file on the SD card.

#### 3.4. User Interface
- Implement basic controls to start and stop data logging.
- Use LEDs or an LCD (if available) to indicate the status of data logging.

### Detailed Steps

#### Step 1: Set Up ADCs in Triple Interleaved Mode
- Use STM32CubeMX to configure the three ADCs.
- Ensure they are set to operate in triple interleaved mode.
- Set each ADC to sample at 2.4 Msps to achieve a combined rate of 7.2 Msps.

#### Step 2: Configure DAC to Generate Test Signal
- Configure the DAC to output a specific waveform, such as a sine wave, square wave, or triangle wave.
- Use a timer to control the DAC output rate, ensuring it matches the desired signal frequency.

#### Step 3: Configure DMA
- Configure DMA in circular mode to continuously transfer data from ADCs to a memory buffer.
- Set up the DMA stream and channel appropriately for the ADCs.

#### Step 4: Implement Data Buffering and Storage
- Define a memory buffer large enough to hold the sampled data.
- Implement a routine to transfer data from the buffer to the SD card.

#### Step 5: Create User Interface
- Implement basic controls (e.g., buttons) to start and stop logging.
- Use LEDs to indicate logging status (e.g., blinking during logging).

### Final Validation
- Generate a known signal (e.g., sine wave) using the DAC.
- Capture the signals using the ADC data logger and store them on the SD card.
- Validate the captured data by analyzing the files stored on the SD card.

This project will effectively showcase the use of ADC in triple interleaved mode with DMA on an STM32F4 microcontroller, demonstrating high-speed data acquisition and efficient data handling along with signal generation using the DAC.
